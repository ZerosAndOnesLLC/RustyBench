## Features

- üî• Multi-threaded CPU benchmarks
- üí´ GPU compute and memory benchmarks using wgpu
- üìä Detailed performance metrics and scoring
- üéØ Quick test mode for rapid system assessment
- üåà Beautiful colored console output
- üíª Cross-platform support (Windows, Linux, ARM)

## CPU Benchmarks

RustyBench performs the following CPU tests:

- **Floating Point**: Complex floating-point operations (sin, cos, tan, exp)
- **Integer**: Intensive integer arithmetic with bit manipulation
- **Memory**: Random access patterns and memory bandwidth testing
- **Prime**: Prime number calculation for computational performance

## GPU Benchmarks

The GPU benchmark suite includes:

- **Compute Performance**: Parallel floating-point operations using compute shaders
- **Memory Bandwidth**: High-throughput memory transfer tests
- **Device Information**: Detailed GPU capabilities reporting

## System Requirements

### Minimum Requirements
- Rust 1.70 or higher
- 2GB RAM
- x86_64 or ARM64 processor
- GPU with Vulkan, Metal, or DirectX 12 support

### Supported Platforms
- Windows 10/11 (x86_64)
- Ubuntu 24.04 (x86_64)
- Ubuntu 24.04 ARM64 (tested on Raspberry Pi 5)

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Rust installed:
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

2. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rustybench.git
cd rustybench
```

3. Build the project:
```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Usage

RustyBench supports several command-line options:

```bash
# Run all benchmarks (CPU + GPU)
./rustybench

# Run only CPU benchmarks
./rustybench cpu

# Run quick CPU benchmarks (3s instead of 10s per test)
./rustybench cpu --quick

# Run only GPU benchmarks
./rustybench gpu

# Run all benchmarks in quick mode
./rustybench all --quick
```

## Sample Output

```

## Understanding the Results

- **Ops/s**: Operations per second - higher is better
- **Score**: Normalized score accounting for CPU cores and operation complexity
- **MOps/s**: Million operations per second for GPU compute
- **MB/s**: Memory bandwidth in megabytes per second
